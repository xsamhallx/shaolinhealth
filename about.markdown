# About Us

Since 1965, Shi Fu Serge has been training students in Shaolin at the University of Sydney.

In that time, he's gathered some thoughts on the subjects taught; buddhist philosophy, unarmed combat, stick fighting and posture and energy.

This blog is where he'd like to share some of those thoughts with you.

For more details, head over to Serge's website at [body-mind.net.au][1]. If you're interested in training with Serge, check it out [here][2].
