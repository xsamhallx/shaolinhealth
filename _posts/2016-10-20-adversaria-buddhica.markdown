## PROLEGOMENA
In the early 1960s when I began to study Chinese language, history and culture, I discovered Herbert
A. Giles and his Adversaria Sinica. As Giles pointed out, the word adversaria is not synonymous
with the adjective adversarial ‘involving or characterized by conflict or opposition’. It’s the Latin
word for ‘journal’ and usually indicates ‘a miscellaneous collection of notes, remarks, or selections’.
Giles was a renowned Sinologist and scholar of note. His erudition might be expected to shame a
mere mortal (like me) into silence - a rare occurrence, as anyone who knows me might concur.
Instead of shaming me into silence, I noticed that Giles had an admirable and scholarly way of
putting down intellectual pretensions of all kinds. He didn’t suffer fools.
Since I enjoy jotting down notes concerning scholarly topics (e.g. Buddhist philosophy) that interest
me, and enjoy the un-Buddhist activity of sniping at those who are happy to go to press – despite the
fact they appear to be sillier than I am – I’ve decided to follow Giles lead and start a series of ‘jottings’
tentatively dubbed Adversaria Buddhica.
This is, in part, a reflection of my laziness.
But, I suspect that if I wait until I’m ready to produce a Buddhist Encyclopaedia, there aren’t enough
potential lifetimes in the trichiliocosm to see me through. Thus, ‘jottings’ will have to do.
As a Great Man once said: "Those that know me judge me by my works".
As my wife has said, on more than one occasion: "Serge’s idea of subtlety and humour is based on the
Buddhist sādhana pattern of 108,000 repetitions". I suspect this is a roundabout or polite way of
saying my customary levity 'floats' like a lead balloon!
Given these observations (confessions?), I don’t guarantee that my ‘jottings’ will make for light
reading.
I don’t expect them to be plagiarized by Marshall McLuhan’s mass media.
But, since I realized years ago that if people are looking for Kentucky Fried Chicken or McDonald’s
burgers, they know where to go, I don’t see a need to appeal to anyone who’s not already interested in
what I’m interested in.
I don’t see myself as a ‘Buddhist’ evangelist.
What I write is for my own possible erudition and for the possible erudition of my students and
friends.
Those who aren’t interested in what I have to say are unlikely to read my jottings or seek me out.
As those who know me well are already aware, I’m not averse to the use of nominally ‘vulgar’
expressions. I speak several languages and, in my experience, the main purpose of language is clarity
in communication, and most vulgar words have an ‘earthy’ depth that’s often lacking in the artificial
or ‘polished’ (aka ‘polite’) attempts at communication on the part those who see language as a means
of social posturing.
Hence, if ‘robust’ language frightens or disgusts you, I recommend you avoid reading my jottings.
Those of you who are sufficiently patient and brave enough to navigate the shoals of inevitable
bullshit are welcome to respond to my jottings as you see fit. I’m not averse to intelligent ‘adversity’
in the normal sense of the word. I just refuse to suffer fuck-wits!
Enjoy!
## BOOK REVIEW: ['Omniscience and the Rhetoric of Reason'][1] by Sara L. McClintock.

Sara McClintock is Associate Professor of Religion at Emory University, where she teaches courses
in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism and interpretation theory in the study of religion.
This work begins at the beginning and should be read in full. A priori views are best left unstated and
judgment reserved until the entire work has been, at the very least, speed-read.
In Dogmas, Connotations, and Contexts (Ch. 3, p. 113) McClintock presents the views of Pierre
Hadot on the practice of philosophia in ancient Greece and suggests that a similar process was in
place in India at the time of Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla.
Given that both Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla were abbots at Nalanda University, one would be
foolish indeed to consider approaching their work superficially.
In the absence of a patient, scholarly mind, one might as well stick to Superman Comics rather than
‘playing at’ reading this work.
In this context, I’m coming to appreciate the Oxford and Cambridge notion of ‘reading’ a course of
study. Before one presumes to understand any subject whatsoever, one needs the intelligence,
patience and perseverance to study its written presentations. ‘Pedagogical devices’, ‘Existential
concerns’ and ‘words as mirrors’ are so many excuses for an unwillingness or incapacity to knuckle
down and study whatever it is that one seeks to understand.
The author examines a passage by Kamalaśīla, in which he (Kamalaśīla) asserts that omniscience
“comes about through the elimination of the afflictive and epistemic obscurations” (p.127). [MY
NOTE - 'afflictive obscurations' is the English translation of Sanskrit kleśāvarana, 'epistemic
obscurations' is the English translation of Sanskrit: jñeyāvarana. Both are mentioned below]. In
clarifying Kamalaśīla’s statement, she points out that of the three poisons (viṣatraya; triviṣa): “...
Ignorance is the most basic, for without it, the other two are not possible. Given their close
dependence on ignorance, it is not surprising to find Kamalaśīla stating that the kleśas ‘block the
vision of what is real’”. (p. 128)
She goes on to state that according to Kamalaśīla, “The vision of what is real is the vision of
selflessness (nairātmyadarśana), and we know from other passages that the authors hold this vision
of selflessness to be the antidote (pratipakṣa) to ignorance and therefore to all afflictions.” (p. 128)
She elaborates this conclusion but goes on to clarify that the passages she quotes also indicate that:
“... one may destroy the kleśāvarana without at the same time destroying the jñeyāvarana.”

## MY NOTE
the distinction between kleśāvarana and jñeyāvarana is an elaboration of the Mahāyāna
and a means of distinguishing between the purported 'lesser' liberation of (the Mahāyāna notion) of
an arhat and the 'greater' liberation of (the Mahāyāna notion) of a bodhisattva].

## ATTA RAKKHITA SANGHA
On Thursday 11th June 2015, while training in the General Fitness Room, I announced setting up the
Atta Rakkhita Sangha. In making the announcement, I was gauging the potential interest of our
normal Shaolin training participants. Those present (in alphabetical order) were Terry Constanti,
John Di Giorgio, Tony Henshaw, Richard O’Brien, Jesse Perez/Chard, Stefan Schmidt, Wadi Sguabi,
Steve Vella and Dan Watson.
On all counts, your response was positive.
Richard (wisely?) pointed out “It’ll take time”, to which I responded with the question “Have you
ever masturbated?”... After he got over the surprise (shock?) he admitted: “Once or twice...” to which
I responded: “It took time...”
Tony Henshaw quipped in with “You can’t find time...” or “It’s hard to find time...” And so it went on
until, thankfully, we ran out of time...
As most of you know, of late we’ve all been indisposed with the ‘flu, and in Jesse’s case, a near-death
experience while on a working trip to Japan. Hence this short ‘policy statement’, appears in print for
the very first time on these hallowed pages of our Meetup Message Board.
ATTA RAKKHITA SANGHA
The ‘Discourse on the Self-Protected’ (Atta Rakhita Sutta) reports a conversation between King
Pasenadi of Kosala and the Buddha.
The king tells the Buddha how, during a solitary retreat, he realized that although he might be
protected by a company of elephants, of cavalry, of chariots or of infantry, were he to conduct himself
badly in body, speech and mind, he would remain unprotected.
Military might or fighting prowess represents external protection, whereas conducting oneself well in
body, speech and mind represents internal protection.
As for what such good conduct consists of, it consists of self-restraint.
This is the gist of the Buddhist view on the fundamentals of self-protection.

The Atta Rakkhita Sangha is a community of laypersons dedicated to all expressions of self-
protection, including those that might be considered provisional.

Being laypersons, we do not unreservedly observe all the Patimokkha rules of the Vinaya Pitaka
enjoined on Buddhist monks and nuns.
Like all intelligent laypersons, throughout history, throughout the known world, we do not commit to
the fullness of the lifestyle chosen by Buddhist monks and nuns.
Instead, we have chosen to commit to the fullness of the layperson’s lifestyle.
Remembering (Pālī: sati; Sanskrit: smṛtī) that we have chosen to live as laypersons, it’s advisable to
desist from romanticized views of the celibate lifestyle. If we choose to desist from socially acceptable
sexual relationships, nothing prevents us from doing so!
But, to be living in the world (and therefore being at least partly of the world) it is counter-productive
and rather infantile to be romancing about what (for us) is effectively an imaginary scenario
concerning a lifestyle we have little (if any) desire to pursue.
We do our best to act in a sober and considerate manner befitting responsible adult members of
society, indulging in the kinds of social intercourse acceptable in most modern civilized Societies.
At the same time, we accept and recognize the right of any adult man or woman to pursue a celibate
lifestyle, if they choose to do so freely and without psychological or physical coercion on the part of a
third party or parties.

Our members practice a specific expression of Shaolin, a Chinese Buddhist tradition of self-
cultivation and self-defense.

In keeping with the central teaching of the Atta Rakkhita Sutta, we accept that although self-
restraint might be considered the ultimate self-protection, we reserve the right to exercise

provisional self-protection as we deem fit.
