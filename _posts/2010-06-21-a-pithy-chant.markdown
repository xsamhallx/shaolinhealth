Contrary to what an uninformed reader might otherwise surmise, the heading a pithy chant is not
meant to indicate the song of a drunken person with a speech impediment. It indicates a short
mnemonic verse that summarizes fundamentals.
In the last six months, we’ve covered much of the rationale that underpins our Shaolin practice.
Those who demonstrated a necessary and sufficient interest in the tradition were introduced to a
pithy chant that covers the essence of the teaching.
The innermost understanding of any practitioner is dependent on the presence of basic intelligence
nurtured by application (study and meditation) and culminating in fruition. The nature of language
is sequential and, because conceptual elaborations systematically expressed in words follow a linear
pattern, we automatically fall into patterns of thinking based on ‘means and ends’ otherwise
expressed as ‘paths and goals’.
Like our springtime calisthenics, beginners tend to imagine that we do them as means (paths) to the
end (goal) of strong muscles. They fail to realize that the exercises are grounded in a capacity and
that the path of performing them is the expression or realization of their end-point or goal.
Buddhism is not unique in recognizing that for the purpose of discussion, all human activity can be
subsumed under the headings of mind, voice and gesture (or thought, word and deed). Nor is it
unique in recognizing that the potential help we draw from any teaching depends on our readiness to
apply it.
In recognition of the fact that a human being is not only ‘an animal capable of reason’ but also ‘an
animal capable of association’, all human traditions are based on fellowship. The spiritual value of
faithful friends is beyond measure.
Faced with an individual who demands a definition of fidelity and friendship, I observe silence. If
you're unsure, I'd humbly suggest that the best way to find out is to work it out.
Towards this end, skilful interaction helps to deepen our understanding and appreciation.
Buddhism is a tradition that stresses applied intelligence.
Intelligence involves observation.
In the vacuum of cessation (nirodha) there may well be peace (samatha) but on returning to the
merry-go-round (samsara) of everyday life, the pressing concerns that assail us cannot be resolved
by mere passivity. As we breathe, we think and as we think, we act.
By learning to observe the condition that is coming to be (yathabhuta), we perceive patterns and
spontaneously steer our way through the tortuous labyrinth that would otherwise entrap and
immobilize us.
Our calisthenics (whether performed in springtime or during the depths of winter) work in much the
same way. When we observe that our own condition is one of limited mobility, weakness or
discomfort, we move with strength and comfort, thereby expressing our innate, presence and
potential.
If we fail to observe timely signs and choose to desist from the ongoing expression of presence and
potential, our innate capacities prematurely fade away.
