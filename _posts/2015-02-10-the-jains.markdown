**For those of us with an appreciation of history and an interest in Buddhism, an understanding of the ascetic extremes that the Buddha sought to avoid in his practice and presentation of the Middle Way is at the very least interesting. In view of the Buddha's gentle ridicule of what he considered the unreasonable asceticism (and its accompanying philosophical underpinnings including the logic of syādvāda) of the Jains, even a brief acquaintance with their doctrines should prove enlightening.**

An excellent introduction by Johann Georg Bühler (July 19, 1837 – April 8, 1898), the renowned scholar of ancient Indian languages and law entitled [On the Indian Sect of the Jainas][1] is accessible on the internet

As I suggest above, Georg Bühler's presentation is an *introduction*, in its own way unavoidably *dated*. Nevertheless, Bühler's scholarly stature has never been in doubt and much of what he had to say over a century ago is as valid today as it was then.

I trust that this brief introduction will whet your appetites and, perhaps give you a better understanding of how the Buddha's rejection of the the current understanding of mortifying (i.e. *lethal*) asceticism in favour of a Middle Way led the five ascetics who originally accompanied him on his spiritual quest to at one stage abandon him.

As for the Jains themselves, whatever your views on their form of asceticism, their long tradition of spiritual 'thoroughness' and the social ethics they expound are both well worth considering.

Apropos of the Jains and Jainism, it is interesting to note that although Mohandas Gandhi was a Vaishnava by birth, his family had longstanding relations with Jains and Jain influence extended into all aspects of [his early life and eventual teachings][2] especially the Jain teaching on the central role of non-violence.

**According to an ancient tradition, a Jain gymnosophist ('naked philosopher') who exerted a profound influence on Alexander the Great and prophesied the later's death was known to Alexander's Macedonians as Kalanos, presumably because he was accustomed to chanting the name of the Goddess Kali. [Kalanos][3]/[Calanus][4] is thought to have been a member of the Digambara ('sky clad' - i.e. naked)) sect of Jains**
