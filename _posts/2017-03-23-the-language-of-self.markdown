Last night ‘the Duke’ (aka Iustus / o Δίκαιος / Justin) turned up at training with a refreshingly
unaffected confidence in attempting to elaborate – in casual conversation – his viewpoint of ‘self’
(Pāli: attā; Sanskrit: ātman).
One of our members emailed me with the observation: “Well, he certainly gives a fresh spin on the
old adage of being a ‘cup so full of tea that no more can fit in’!”
After considering the response of the writer of the email, and recognising that for anyone acquainted
with the niceties of Buddhist discourse, the point raised is valid enough, I replied: “At first sight
(hearing?), that might be the general consensus.
But, a closer look reveals all kinds of interesting alternative views.
Perhaps he simply hasn’t learned to 'talk the talk’ (in terms of anattā/anātman) while nonetheless,
he still attempts to (and to some degree manages to) ‘walk the walk’.
According to Buddhist teachings, the ‘feeling of self’ or subjectivity is an empirical ‘given’ (Latin
datum, sg. of data).
Buddhist think-talk is the outcome of an attempt to make sense of, or account for, the undeniable
experience of subjectivity without drawing unnecessary and stupefying (Pāli/Sanskrit: moha)
metaphysical conclusions based on such undeniable experience.
Nominal ‘Buddhists' - like all those who attempt to exercise intelligence - might remind their
conventional ‘selves’ that the name-of-the-game is investigation. Such investigation involves
examining how ‘self’ and ‘other’ manifest.
Before we accept (aka ‘affirm’) or reject (aka ‘deny’) attā/ātman, we have to establish what the fuck
we mean by the word. Otherwise, we end up ‘pissing in the wind,’ aka begging the question – i.e.
framing it in a way that gives us back our own ignorance-based input rather than revealing anything
meaningful about the purported subject of investigation (Pāli: dhamma vicaya; Sanskrit; dharma
pravicaya).
As I see it, the first question proposed by the Buddha (and the late Ramana Maharshi of
Tiruvannamalai) remains: What is this thing (Pāli: dhamma; Sanskrit: dharma) we’re calling ’self’.
Once we’ve answered this question, we can start arguing about its ontological status.”

I hope that at least some of you will see fit to comment. My only humble suggestion is that you re-
think what you immediately thought, before presenting your thinking in writing.

If this topic appears trivial to you, you have a long trip on the way to an understanding of a major
topic of interest characteristic of the system(s) of thought covered by the broad umbrella labelled
'Buddhism.'
