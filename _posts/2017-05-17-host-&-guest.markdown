Most languages display a certain mystique with reference to the Host-Guest relationship. A minimum of introspection will allow most of us to 'sense' why this is so.

In English, an alternative expression for 'good manners' - an expression that says, in plain terms, exactly what it means - is 'polite'. This word derives from Latin politus, past participle of polire "to polish, smooth out, clean." Another expression is 'courteous,
derived from Old French curteis (Modern French courtois) 'having courtly bearing or manners,' from curt 'court,' itself derived from the Latin cors.

In this context, there's a tendency to assume the 'court' in question refers to the court of a noble or royal personage.

This is an example of the ever-present danger of terminating one's etymological investigations short of the mark.

The Latin cortem, accusative of cors (earlier cohors) 'enclosed yard,' and by extension, 'those assembled in the yard; company, cohort,' from com- "together" + stem hort- related to hortus'garden, plot of ground,' itself related - via PIE ghor-to- 'to grasp, enclose,' with the derivative meaning of 'enclosure,' to the English 'yard'.

To cut a long story short, the most common ancient and modern Chinese expression for
'polite' or 'well mannered' is kèqì (客氣) literally '(to have) the airs or manners (qì 氣) of a guest (kè 客).

At first sight, this might appear far removed from our notion of 'courtly,' if we make the mistake of assuming the 'court' in question refers to a 'noble' or 'royal' residence. As the word court or yard originally signified an enclosed space, that commonly indicates the notion of 'private property', the Chinese idea of 'guest-like behaviour" is not that far removed from our idea of courtly, which ultimately signifies the kind of behaviour considered appropriate when we're not on home ground!

At first sight, an unthinking observer might be forgiven for asking why there's not a corresponding mirror-image linguistic construction 'lord-like behaviour' of the Chinese 'guest-like behaviour.'

A little thought reveals that 'lord-like behaviour' involves treating one's guests as if they belong in his home, rather than as 'strangers' or 'trespassers.'

Another observation might be that even in what is nominally 'one's own' home, it's useful to remember that in a sense, each of us is a 'guest' and is well advised to behave accordingly.

Last but not least, this post really belongs under the Message Board title Adversaria Buddhica, since its main purpose is to comment on the dangers of literal translation, especially when Buddhist philosophy and psychology are concerned.

A few years ago, I observed that all kinds of unnecessary misunderstandings arise when Chinese Buddhist technical terms are translated literally without the benefit of an idiomatic gloss.

A prime example is the unnecessary confusion that has arisen in English translations of the Ch’an/Zen (禪) technical terms host (主) and guest (客). In his 3 volume series Ch’an and Zen Teaching, the late Charles Luk - a kind and courteous gentleman (and scholar) with whom I had the pleasure of corresponding, chose to translate these words literally.

Luk’s choice is in one sense commendable, because it forces his reader to think laterally.

However, in attempting to think through the ramifications of the host-guest relationship, his reader might easily be led into ‘conceptual proliferation’ or ‘prolix discursiveness’ (Pali: papañca, Sanskrit: prapañca, Chinese: 戲論) without necessarily understanding the central issue.

English readers might care to note that the Chinese idioms ‘host view’ (主觀) and ‘guest view’ (客觀) express the English idioms ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’.

In Master Hsu-yun's guidelines on meditation (as translated by Charles Luk), what he was suggesting is that in the practice of Ch’an/Zen (禪) meditation, all meditators are advised to begin meditation from the ‘observer’ pole – i.e. by operating as subjects viewing objects. From this perspective, that aspect of mind that is aware of thoughts is the subject/host (主) and the thoughts of which it is aware are its objects/guests (客).

There is no extant Ch'an/Zen sect that considers the assumption of the Host-position (aka subjectivity) to be the end. They simply all agree that any attempt to proceed in its absence effectively ensures there's no start.
