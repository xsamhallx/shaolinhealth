At first sight, the general concept 'relativity' seems straightforward enough. If this is your impression, I suggest you take the first step in Buddhist meditation and clear (your) mind of preconceptions (Sanskriti: jñeya-āvaraṇa) before proceeding on a lifetime of research.

In Buddhism, the main presentation of general 'relatedness/relativity' is 'Dependent Co-Arising' (Pali: paṭiccasamuppāda, Sanskrit: Pratītyasamutpāda) which states that 'things' (Pali: dhamma, Sanskrit: dharma) arise in dependence on other 'things'.

For the Chinese Taoist presentation of 'relativity', I suggest you read the works of Chuang Tzu 莊子 (399 - 295 B.C.), especially his amusing tale concerning the perspective of a frog who lived in a well!

I apologise for pre-empting your enjoyment and consequent enlightenment by 'jumping the gun', even before you've read Chuang tzu. Ask yourself how different you and I might be from a frog who's lived his whole life at the bottom of a well? Is our perspective vastly different?

Have you ever eavesdropped on the conversations of others (God forbid!), especially when unaware of the context. Were you impressed?

What I'm trying to say is that 'interest' and 'interesting' is a relative term and has relativevalue. What interests one person will drive another witless!

If through the proverbial 'Act of God', members of the general public were made privy to the recent spate of 'Dear All' emails (let alone recent personal, one-to-one emails) I suspect they'd be bored witless (or, perhaps, an 8-letter word that ends in -less says it better)!

Given these observations - how 'relevant' they (i.e. the emails) are is itself relative - I trust you'll appreciate the wisdom of observing 'degrees of intimacy' in our Meetup communication.

When the wisdom of observing the undeniable need for 'degrees of intimacy' gets out of hand, exoteric and esoteric presentations take over. Favoured members find themselves in the Inner Circle, while others are relegated to the fringes.

This nonsense is an ever-present danger.

However, it can't be avoided by adhering to misunderstandings of the ideal of egalitarianism that suggest illiteracy is adequate for admission to the university (although, judging from experience, I often wonder?).

This particular storm, in this particular teacup is relatively insignificant.

However, in its 'relatedness/relativity', it represents a constant pattern easy to recognise in the myriad manifestations of Life. If we believe ourselves to be truly alive, we could do worse than to recognise it and use our wits in applying it.
