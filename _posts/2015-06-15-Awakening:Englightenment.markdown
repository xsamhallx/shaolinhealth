**The word buddha (from: bodhi 'awakening') means 'awakened one'... By extension, it means 'enlightened' in the sense that prior to the advent of inexpensive and efficient artificial lighting, our ancestors enjoyed the light and visibility afforded by the moon, especially around the time of the full moon... But, at other times, were wont to rest during the hours of maximum darkness and awaken when the sun rose...**

The Buddha's message of Awakening or Enlightenment is extremely attractive to a sight-dominant species still hard-wired to fear darkness and the invisibility that darkness confers on nocturnal carnivores, pot holes and cliff edges (to name just a few of the ever-present potential dangers in the environment)...

Although Europeans were aware of the Buddha and his teachings from at least the 4th century BC, when Alexander the Great conquered part of N.W. India, it was not until the late 19th century that major Europeans thinkers including Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Blavatsky took a serious interest in Buddhism...

Building on our species's innate attraction to all nuances associated with the experience of light, and following on the European Age of Enlightenment (c. 1650'd - c. 1680s), 19th century thinkers could hardly fail to see Buddhism's stress on 'awakening/enlightenment' in a positive light (sic!)...

Before we get carried away with mental fabrications (Pali: *saṅkhāra*) and prolix discursiveness (Pali: *papañca*), it's helpful to remember that most languages (including Pali and Sanskrit) use the notion of wakefulness as a metaphor for intelligence...

The word 'stupid' literally means 'asleep', and few if any of our peers would blame us for being unresponsive to environmental cues while we're asleep... Recognising this fact, most species that spend part of their lives asleep choose to sleep in relatively safe environments so they might hope to live long enough to produce descendants...

If we allow, for one moment, that whatever else 'awakening/enlightenment' might imply in Buddhism, its primary meaning remains 'intelligence/perceptivity/understanding­',
we might ask what it is that the early (and later) Buddhist sages *understood* by those presentations of the teaching that affected them 'to the core'...

This short post is not intended to plunge its readers into the deep ocean of Buddhist hermeneutics... Feel free to pause when you reach knee-depth...

As yet, we're nowhere near Groucho Marx's suggested depth when he and his family were living in a benighted American town where 'Jews and Blacks' were not allowed in the local swimming pool...

Groucho wrote to the administrators: "My daughter's half-Gentile... Is it alright if she goes in up to the waist?"...

Regarding the topic at hand, much of what the Buddha had to say is perfectly clear here and now (Pali: *sanditthiko*), is timeless (Pali: *akaliko*), readily available for anyone willing to look (Pali: *ehipassiko*), conducive (Pali: *opanayiko*) and perceptible (Pali: *veditabbo*) for oneself (Pali: *paccattam*) by anyone capable of using his senses (Pali: *viññuhi*)...

The problem arises when we attempt to read 'between the lines' before we've bothered to understand what's plain and simple, 'on the line', straight under our nose...

Those of us who fancy we're intelligent sometimes make the mistake of assuming that if we were to become awakened or enlightened, what used to be wrong will become right... As the Tibetan scholar Jigme Lingpa wrote (in another context), this is like saying that a raven is white... No level of understanding can banish the fact that if we find our hand - uninvited - in someday else's purse, we're stealing...

Most of what the Buddha had to say is no more difficult to understand than what I've just written... The expression of basic human decency does not require a tertiary education... In most human wisdom traditions, the 'rule of thumb' is one or another version of the Principle of Reciprocity (aka *The Golden Rule*) - i.e. *how would you like it?...*

**If you refrain from doing to others what you don't want them to do to you, you've made an excellent start... If you grow beyond this, that's fine... Over the years, I've been tempted to try to transcend petty rules and limitations... But no matter how hard I've tried, how enlightened I've become, how clearly I've seen, I'm happy to say that so far, nothing I've studied has let me see that a raven is white...**
